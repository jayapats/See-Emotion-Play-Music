# Intoduction
Emotions are responses to ones internal and external being. Emotions need to be balanced for a peaceful life. Imbalance of emotion may lead to depression, suicidal attacks and mental illness etc.

Now a days people are busy in their own life and have no one to share their feelings. In such cases music is said to be the best companion.

This idea led me to develop this project – See Emotion and Play Music (SEPM), which is a mood based music player.
